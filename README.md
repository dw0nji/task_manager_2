# Task Manager

Welcome to our Task Manager Flutter project.

This project with the sole purpose to familliarize ourselves with Flutter, strengthen our skills like; programming and git. And implementing the MVC Architecture. 
The project consists of a fully functional todo-list and calendar section, in order to make the authentication, database and other Firebase features work, please replace the redundant api keys with your own and setup any changes accordingly.
. All API keys are redundant so don't even get excited!

This project was created by Jonathan Ewers (Me) and Murray Buchanan.
