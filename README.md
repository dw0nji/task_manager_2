# Task Manager

Welcome to our Task Manager Flutter project.

This project with the sole purpose to familliarize ourselves with Flutter, strengthen our skills like; programming and git. And implementing the MVC Architecture. 
The project consists of a fully function todo-list section and calendar. All API keys are redundant so don't even get excited!

In order to get the Firebase stuff working, please replace the redundant api keys with your own and setup any changes accordingly.

This project was worked on by Jonathan Ewers (Me) and Murray Buchanan.
